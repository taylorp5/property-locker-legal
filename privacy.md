# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: {{ "now" | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}_

**Property Locker** (“we”, “our”, “us”) operates the Property Locker mobile application (“App”).
This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use the App.

## Information We Collect
- **Account**: email, name (if provided).
- **Session data**: property address, unit, labels you create.
- **Photos & metadata**: images you capture, timestamps, and (if you grant permission) location (GPS).
- **Device info**: app version, OS version for diagnostics.
- **Analytics**: basic usage to improve stability and features (no ads).

## How We Use Information
- To operate core features (capture, organize, and export your move-in/move-out photos).
- To generate reports and share links you request.
- To improve reliability, performance, and usability.
- To respond to support requests (if you contact us).

## Location (GPS)
If you enable location, we may record GPS coordinates at capture time for photos to help validate where/when a photo was taken. You can disable this in your device settings or in-app.

## Sharing
We do not sell your data. We may share with service providers that help us run the App (e.g., hosting, storage). When you generate share links, anyone with the link can view content you’ve chosen to share.

## Data Retention
We retain your data while your account is active or as needed to provide the App. You may request deletion by contacting us.

## Your Choices
- You can revoke location permissions at any time.
- You can delete photos, sessions, and your account.

## Security
We take reasonable measures to protect your information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

## Children
The App is not directed to children under 13.

## Changes
We may update this policy from time to time. We will post updates here with a new “Last updated” date.
